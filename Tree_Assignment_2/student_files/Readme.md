<h2> Project Malmo Maze Solver </h2>
<h4> Introduction </h4> 
This project involves creating an agent to traverse a maze in Minecraft using Project Malmo. The agent will utilize tree searching algorithms to find a goal block in the maze.

<h4> Requirements </h4> 
To run this project, you will need the following software:

[Project Malmo]{https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo}
[Minecraft]{https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download}
[Python 3]{https://www.python.org/downloads/}

<h4> Tree Searching Algorithms </h4>
The agent will utilize one of the following tree searching algorithms to find the goal block:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
A\* Search

The algorithm can be specified in the code.

<h4> Conclusion </h4>
This project showcases the implementation of tree searching algorithms in the context of a Minecraft maze. The agent can successfully traverse the maze and reach the goal block using the specified algorithm.
