# Tutorials for Python ACT-R
- Last modified by Dr. Chris Dancy, March-2023

This directory contains tutorials from the original Python ACT-R. **Note that many of these won't work**
This due to my needing to update modules and pointers for many of these examples. The GUI-based tutorials will likely present the biggest difficulties in conversions
As I update them, I'll try to note below which tutorials have been converted
